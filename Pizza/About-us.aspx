		<center><h1>-----ABOUT AS-----</h1></center>
		<h3 style="color:gray;">
			<p>It was the summer of 1958 when Dan and Frank Carney decided to open a pizzeria. With mouth-watering pizzas prepared 
			by the founders themselves, M's Pizza soon became the most popular neighbourhood restaurant. From then to over 16,500 
			restaurants across the world today, we have come a long way.</p>

			<p>Today, M's Pizza is about much more than pizzas. From freshly sauteed pastas & delicious appetizers to	mocktails, 
			desserts, soups and salads, we have a wide range for you to feast on. All this, combined with the warm, inviting ambience
			and friendly service, will lead to endless conversations, laughter and memories that you'll cherish forever. So, 
			let your hair down and feel at ease. Go ahead and enjoy the All New M'S Pizza experience!</p>
